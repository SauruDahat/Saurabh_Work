# Social Buzz Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the data analytics conducted for **Social Buzz**, a fast-growing technology unicorn established in 2010. With over **500 million active monthly users**, Social Buzz generates vast amounts of content daily. Our team partnered with **Accenture** for a 3-month proof of concept (POC) to analyze their content and provide strategic insights, including:
- An audit of Social Buzz’s Big Data practices.
- Recommendations for a successful IPO.
- Identification of the top 5 most popular content categories.

## Problem
Social Buzz generates over **100,000 posts per day**, which adds up to **36.5 million posts per year**. Handling such massive data presents significant challenges, particularly in uncovering meaningful insights that can be leveraged to improve engagement and support future business growth.

## Process
The data analytics process followed five key stages:
1. **Data Understanding**: Exploration of Social Buzz’s extensive data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Filtering irrelevant and duplicate data to ensure accuracy.
3. **Data Analysis**: Identifying key trends and patterns.
4. **Uncovering Insights**: Distilling actionable insights from the data.
5. **Data Modeling**: Creating models that represent the findings and recommendations.

## Key Insights
- Social Buzz’s content spans **16 unique categories**, with **Animals**, **Science**, **Healthy Eating**, **Technology**, and **Food** being the most popular categories.
- Users primarily engage with **Photo** and **Video** formats over other types of content like GIFs and Audio.
- The highest posting activity occurs in the month of **May**, offering a strategic opportunity for marketing and engagement.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations were made:
